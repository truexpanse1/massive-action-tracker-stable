# Sales Target Calculator - User Guide

## What This Tool Does

The **Massive Action Targets** calculator helps you turn a big money goal into a simple daily plan. It uses basic math to figure out exactly what you need to do every day to hit your annual revenue target.

### The Big Idea

Instead of guessing how many calls to make, this calculator works **backward** from your goal:

1. Start with how much money you want to make
2. Figure out how many sales you need
3. Calculate how many leads and opportunities required
4. Break it down into daily activities

**Result:** You get a clear daily plan that, if followed consistently, will get you to your goal.

## How to Use It

### Step 1: Your Money Goal

**Question 1: How much money do you want to make this year?**
- Enter your annual revenue goal
- Example: $500,000

**Question 2: How much is one sale worth?**
- Enter your average deal size or commission
- Example: $5,000 per customer

### Step 2: Your Time

**Question 3: How many days will you work this year?**
- Usually 250 days (5 days/week × 50 weeks)
- Adjust if you take more time off
- Example: 240 days if you take 3 weeks vacation

**Question 4: How many days does it take to close a sale?**
- From first contact to money in the bank
- Be realistic - include follow-up time
- Example: 30 days for most B2B sales, 45 days for real estate

### Step 3: Your Success Rates

**Question 5: Out of 100 leads, how many become real opportunities?**
- A "lead" is someone you contacted
- An "opportunity" is someone ready to buy
- Example: 25% (25 out of 100)

**Question 6: Out of 100 opportunities, how many buy?**
- Your close rate
- Be honest - this is critical
- Example: 25% (1 in 4 closes)

**💡 Don't Know Your Rates?**
If you're new or don't track these numbers:
- Start with 25% for both (industry average)
- Track your actual numbers for 30 days
- Come back and update the calculator

### Step 4: Your Activities

**For each lead, how many times do you...**

- **Call them?** (Usually 3 calls)
- **Email them?** (Usually 5 emails)
- **Text them?** (Usually 2 texts)

These are your activity ratios. Adjust based on your sales process.

### Step 5: Calculate

Click **"Show Me My Daily Plan"** and the calculator will show you:

1. **Your Daily Plan** - What to do every single day
2. **Weekly Targets** - What to hit each week
3. **Monthly Targets** - What to hit each month
4. **The Big Picture** - Your full year breakdown

## Understanding Your Results

### Daily Plan (Most Important!)

This is broken into three sections that match your **EOD Report**:

#### ⚡ ACTIVITY (Morning Work)
- **Calls to Make** - How many dials
- **Emails to Send** - Follow-up emails
- **Texts to Send** - Quick check-ins
- **New Leads** - People to add to your pipeline

#### 📊 PIPELINE (What You're Building)
- **New Opportunities** - Qualified prospects per day
- **Total Pipeline Needed** - How much $ value to carry

#### 💰 RESULTS (What You'll Make)
- **Sales to Close** - Deals per day (usually a fraction, like 0.4)
- **Money to Make** - Daily revenue target

### Pipeline Health Metrics

**Coverage Ratio (e.g., 4x)**
- How much pipeline you need vs. your goal
- Example: 4x means you need $4 in pipeline for every $1 you want to close
- Lower close rate = higher coverage needed

**Required Pipeline Value**
- Total $ value your pipeline should have
- Example: $2M pipeline to hit $500k goal with 25% close rate

**Sales Velocity**
- How much money your pipeline generates per day
- Helps you forecast when deals will close

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Sales Rep ($500k Goal)

**Inputs:**
- Goal: $500,000/year
- Deal size: $5,000
- Working days: 250
- Sales cycle: 30 days
- Lead → Opp: 25%
- Opp → Close: 25%
- Calls per lead: 3

**Daily Plan:**
- Make 21 calls
- Send 35 emails
- Send 14 texts
- Add 7 new leads
- Close 0.4 deals (2 per week)
- Make $2,000

**The Math:**
```
$500,000 ÷ $5,000 = 100 sales needed
100 ÷ 0.25 = 400 opportunities needed
400 ÷ 0.25 = 1,600 leads needed
1,600 ÷ 250 days = 7 leads/day
7 leads × 3 calls = 21 calls/day
```

### Example 2: Realtor ($300k Goal)

**Inputs:**
- Goal: $300,000/year
- Commission: $12,000 per sale
- Working days: 240
- Sales cycle: 45 days
- Lead → Opp: 20%
- Opp → Close: 30%
- Calls per lead: 4

**Daily Plan:**
- Make 8 calls
- Send 12 emails
- Send 6 texts
- Add 2 new leads
- Close 0.1 deals (2 per month)
- Make $1,250

**Why It Works:**
```
$300,000 ÷ $12,000 = 25 home sales
25 ÷ 0.30 = 84 serious buyers
84 ÷ 0.20 = 420 leads
420 ÷ 240 days = 2 leads/day
2 leads × 4 calls = 8 calls/day
```

### Example 3: Better Conversion Rates

**Same goal ($500k) but better skills:**
- Lead → Opp: 30% (was 25%)
- Opp → Close: 35% (was 25%)

**Result:**
- Only 12 calls/day (was 21)
- Only 4 leads/day (was 7)
- Same revenue!

**Key Insight:** Better conversion rates = less work needed!

## Pro Tips

### 1. Do Calls First
Make all your calls before lunch. Don't check email or do other work first. Prospecting is your #1 priority.

### 2. Track Everything
Write down every call, email, and text. Use your EOD Report. Numbers don't lie - you'll see patterns.

### 3. Adjust Your Rates
After 30 days, calculate your actual conversion rates:
- Leads → Opportunities: Count how many leads became real prospects
- Opportunities → Closed: Count your close rate
- Update the calculator with real numbers

### 4. Focus on What You Can Control
You can control:
- ✅ How many calls you make
- ✅ How many emails you send
- ✅ How many leads you add

You can't control:
- ❌ When people buy
- ❌ Market conditions
- ❌ Competition

Focus on your daily activities. The results will follow.

### 5. Don't Skip Days
If you skip a day, you fall behind. The math is unforgiving:
- Miss 1 day = need 1.2x effort tomorrow
- Miss 1 week = need 1.25x effort next week
- Miss 1 month = nearly impossible to catch up

Consistency beats intensity.

## Common Questions

### Q: What if my numbers seem too high?

**A:** The calculator is showing you the **reality** of hitting your goal. You have three options:

1. **Do the work** - Hit those numbers every day
2. **Improve your conversion rates** - Get better at selling (less work needed)
3. **Lower your goal** - Be realistic about what you can achieve

Most people fail because they set big goals but don't do the daily work required.

### Q: What if I don't know my conversion rates?

**A:** Start with 25% for both (industry average). Track your numbers for 30 days, then update the calculator with your real rates.

### Q: Can I save my plan?

**A:** Yes! Take a screenshot of your daily plan or bookmark this page. In a future update, you'll be able to save multiple scenarios to the Resources section.

### Q: What if my sales cycle is longer than my working days?

**A:** That's normal! The calculator accounts for this with the **pipeline coverage ratio**. You need to build a pipeline now that will pay off later. Focus on adding leads and opportunities today, even if they won't close for 60-90 days.

### Q: Do I need to hit my daily deal target every day?

**A:** No! Deals don't close every day. Your daily deal target (like 0.4) means you need about 2 deals per week or 8-9 per month. Focus on your **activity targets** (calls, emails, leads) - those you CAN control daily.

### Q: What if I have a bad week?

**A:** One bad week won't kill you, but you need to make it up. If you miss your weekly target, you need to work harder next week. The calculator shows you the **minimum** required - doing more is always better.

## The Truth About This Calculator

### What It Will Do

✅ Show you exactly what's required to hit your goal
✅ Give you a clear daily plan
✅ Help you track if you're on pace
✅ Reveal if your goal is realistic

### What It Won't Do

❌ Make calls for you
❌ Improve your sales skills
❌ Guarantee results
❌ Work if you don't follow the plan

### The Bottom Line

This calculator uses simple math to work backward from your goal. The numbers don't lie. If you want to make $500,000 and your average sale is $5,000, you need 100 sales. If you close 25% of opportunities, you need 400 opportunities. If 25% of leads become opportunities, you need 1,600 leads.

**1,600 leads ÷ 250 working days = 7 leads per day.**

That's the reality. You can't negotiate with math.

The question is: **Are you willing to do the work?**
